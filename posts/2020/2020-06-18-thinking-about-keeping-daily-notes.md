# Thinking about keeping my Daily Notes here

Here’s what I’ve been thinking.

You may have noticed that my [Rudimentary Lathe wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org/) has evolved into a blog. 90% of new content is simply added to that day’s “Journal” entry. It got me thinking again about consolidation. I mean, I _have_ a blog, right? You’re reading it now. I wonder if it’s possible to create Daily Notes posts right here instead.

The trick is that there’s an RSS feed, and the day’s post would show up in the feed as soon as it’s first published. Not ideal. I don’t actually want the daily posts to show up in the main feed at all, so I suppose I’d need to categorize them and exclude them from the feed.

I also want today’s post to be “pinned” to the top, even if I add other posts that day.

Ideally, the Daily Notes post would be a collection of microblog posts, collected into one entry. Somehow. That should allow for permalinks to be created for each microblog post in addition to the one for the enclosing post. This is secondary, but feels important enough to consider.

The best example of what I’m looking for is Dave Winer’s [http://scripting.com](http://scripting.com/). Also see [Colin’s blog](https://colinwalker.blog/). And to a lesser degree, [my wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org/).

I’m running this site on WordPress (again) now so I’m betting this is all possible. Just need to find the energy to try it.
