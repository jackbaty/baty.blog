# Lathe Updates: Week Ending July 12, 2020

After moving my daily notes back to the wiki, a couple people mentioned that they missed having the posts available via RSS. Trouble is, one reason I prefer posting those notes on the wiki is _because_ thereâ€™s no RSS feed.

So, as a compromise, I thought Iâ€™d try posting a weekly summary here and see how that feels.

All 7 days transcluded into a single tiddler: [Journals: Week ending July 12, 2020](https://rudimentarylathe.org/index.html#Journals%3A%20Week%20ending%20July%2012%2C%202020)

Or, each day individally.
