# Wall for Blot

[Wall for Blot](https://www.amitgawande.com/1585574384457) from Amit Gawande and David Merfield.

> I have been working with David Merfield on a little side project. The idea started simple - what if there was a simple posting interface for Blot? In extension, something that one can use to write and publish a post to Dropbox. Blot is simple as-is for writing and posting (itâ€™s all files). But there are times when I do want to quickly post from my web browser. And for such times, I still need a simple writing interface.

Posting via simple Markdown files is nice and all, but sometimes one wants to just drop some text into a browser and be done with it. Wall helps with that.
