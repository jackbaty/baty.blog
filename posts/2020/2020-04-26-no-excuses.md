# No excuses not to create something

![Tools at the ready...unused](/_img/2020/2020-04-26_watercolor-tools.jpg)

I have never been an artist, but I used to at least _create_ things. I would draw, paint, write, photograph, you name it. None of these things have been happening lately and I'm not sure why.

Maybe it's because when I was young I imagined that I might actually be (or become) good at something. Now, I know better. I am at least capable of advanced mediocrity on a good day, but that's about it. Still, this shouldn't be an excuse for doing nothing instead. Shitty art is still art. And all the better if it's _my_ shitty art, no?

Boredom may also be a factor. With a computer and an internet connection I never feel bored and that's a shame. I used to do things when I got bored. Now I just keep clicking shit, knowing I'll soon find something to distract me.

And it's not like I don't have time while sequestered. I have time. What I don't have are valid excuses for not doing anything remotely creative.

So I've put drawing and painting tools right out on my desk...immediately available. I have no excuse not to use them.
