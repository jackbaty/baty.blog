# YouTube TV and ads

Our family cut the cable TV cord last year, but we sometimes missed watching "what's on" so I looked into TV streaming services. I had already tried Hulu, but heard good things about [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/) so I signed up.

The first thing I noticed was that it seemed like there were an awful lot of ads, especially for a paid service. So I counted. There were 14 commercials played during a single half-hour episode of Schitt's Creek. Fourteen ads in a row during one show! I'm sorry, but that's insane.

Subscription canceled.
