My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3250841128">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Love the idea of sending someone's consciousness back into a memory, dead memories, rewriting timelines, etc. Characters were interesting. Would've liked more Slade. It got a little wound up toward the end.
