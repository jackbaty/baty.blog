# iPhone SE OG

Look what I found in a drawer! Itâ€™s my favorite iPhone, the original SE. I preferred the flat sides, smaller size, power button at the top, and Touch ID. Oh, and a real headphone jack. Itâ€™s such a great phone.

In the above photo, the home screen is arranged for using the phone in a way I aspire to, meaning hardly at all.

The thing about using a minimally-configured SE is that it feels liberating right up until it becomes frustrating. Using Maps, for example, is much less useful on the SEâ€™s tiny screen. The camera is pretty bad (although I donâ€™t use my phoneâ€™s camera often).

It would be unnecessarily limiting for me to swap the sim card from the iPhone X into the SE. On the other hand, it feels so good in hand and using it would be fun, right?

Iâ€™m going to try it.
