# First draft of new basement workspace

![][image-1]

After I moved in with my wife, this basement bedroom was going to be converted into a darkroom. That hasn't happened, and probably won't, so I'm working on making it into a sort of office/writing space.

I wouldn't mind windows, but short of that I should at least get some photos up on the wall. It's on the list.

For now, I have a large desk, light table, and a small refrigerator. The record player is not far away. I'd say it's a fine start.
