# Getting started with TiddlyWiki: a beginnerâ€™s tutorial - Ness Labs

[Anne-Laure Le Cunff on getting started with TiddlyWiki](https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial):

> If you are looking for an open source alternative to Roam Research, TiddlyWiki is your best bet. Because itâ€™s self-hostedâ€”meaning you keep your data privateâ€”it may seem a bit more daunting to get started. So here is a guide which will take you from complete beginner to completely in love with TiddlyWiki in three steps.

It's written in the context of an alternative to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), so it includes information on integrating [TiddlyBlink](https://giffmex.org/gifts/tiddlyblink.html). There's no mention of the [Timimi extension for Firefox](https://github.com/ibnishak/Timimi) which is my preferred way to edit local wikis.

I haven't had the guts to pull TiddlyBlink into my [main wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) yet, but it's tempting.
