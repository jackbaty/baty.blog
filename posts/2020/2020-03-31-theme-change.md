# Theme change

I ran a quick [poll](https://micro.baty.net/2020/03/29/quick-poll-if.html) to see which theme people preferred for this blog. Opinion was split, but since I was already inclined to use the Daring Fireball-inspired version, I applied some confirmation bias and went with that one...for a day.

After living with it, I found it hard on the eyes. I simply don't like dark themes as much. Images looked awful and were displayed rather small/narrow. Also, other than the specific background color, it really did look like daringfireball.net and that just seemed weird.

So for now I've reset it to the default theme and will work on some tweaks to that. Sorry it's so boring.

Apologies to RSS users, since none of this matters a whit to you :)
