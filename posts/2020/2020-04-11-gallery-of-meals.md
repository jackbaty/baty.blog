# Gallery of meals

The only thing I've been photographing lately are [my meals](https://galleries.baty.net/#15795602458915). 

It started as a way to test [Lychee](https://lycheeorg.github.io) as a gallery, but I kept going. Now it's a habit. I don't pose them or anything. I just set the plate down on my desk and snap a photo from above.
