# Did we ever really understand film? - Dante Stella

[Dante Stella, 2019](https://themachineplanet.wordpress.com/2019/09/25/did-we-ever-really-understand-film/):

> Almost 20 years into the 21st century, conventional black-and-white film has no real mysteries. For most of recorded history, film followed a pretty regimented set of tradeoffs: slower film had finer grain and finer tonal rendition. Things got grainier and lost dynamic range as film increased in speed. Although tablet grained b/w films helped increase performance, most of what you see in black and white films is the product of design tradeoffs rather than some deliberate aesthetic proposition.

> ...as an almost old person, I am not at all hesitant to tell you that everyone in their 20s has a Dunning-Kruger delusion when it comes to the technical aspects of photography. As someone who was there for the twilight of mainstream film photography, I would mostly observe that until the bitter end, film R&D was aimed at making the medium a neutral one that could be manipulated via development, printing, or even scanning â€“ and that today, you can easily mistake random errors for some intentional aesthetic balance

Film stocks aren't magic. I looked for magic for a long time, but found none.
