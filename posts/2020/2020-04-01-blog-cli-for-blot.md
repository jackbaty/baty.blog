# I almost forgot about blog-cli for Blot

Now that I've (re)fired up this [Blot.im](https://blot.im)-based blog, I needed to go through the usual round of learning how to easily create posts for it.

I nearly always post from my Mac, so this leaves the command line as a good option. I'd almost forgotten that I'd forked a [repo from @kahlil](https://github.com/kahlil/blog-cli) and tweaked it for use with Blot. (His works for other static site generators like Hugo).

My fork is here: https://github.com/jackbaty/blog-cli

Note that I haven't done any work to make this generally usable, so you'll want to tweak things somewhat. Probably starting with ./lib/template.js.

Then set the path and editor (see usage instructions) and it's ready to go.

It's nice being in a terminal and typing something like `blog cli-for-blot` and being tossed into my editor du jour, ready to write.
