# Running CloudReady on the 2008 iMac

[Patrick Rhone posted](https://www.patrickrhone.net/7240-2/) a link to a post by Steve Best titled [New Life for an Old iMac](https://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/New-Life-For-iMac). Steve had installed [Neverware's CloudReady](https://www.neverware.com/#intro) OS into an old iMac.

I had never heard of CloudReady.

> Based on Googleâ€™s Chromium OS, the same open-source architecture as Chromebooks and Chrome OS, CloudReady provides unparalleled speed, simplicity, and security without hardware limitations, whether your computers are brand new or 10 years old.

It so happens I had an ancient iMac gathering dust in a closet, so I dragged it out, dusted it off, and set about installing a weird, new-to-me OS.

I [created a boot USB](https://www.neverware.com/freedownload#home-edition-install), fired up the iMac, ran the installer, logged in, and I was up and running. I've never used Chrome OS so the whole thing is new to me, but I now have a 24-inch screen running a simple, fast OS on hardware that was never going to run a modern version of macOS so I'd say it's a win.

The Magic Keyboard paired nicely. The Magic Mouse, while it paired, would not scroll, so I grabbed an old wired mouse until I can figure out why the Apple mouse didn't work. Wifi worked, and so far everything else seems to have worked as well.

I'm not sure what I'll use it for, but it's fun to tinker with.
