# Back to boring keyboards

![](/_img/2020/2020-04-07_keyboards-wm.jpg)

I've been using a Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional (HHKB) [for almost exactly 2 years](https://www.baty.net/2018/the-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-2/). It's my favorite keyboard since the original Apple Extended Keyboard II. I bought two, one for home and one for the office. Those Topre switches are the greatest.

And yet, I'm now using a couple Apple Magic Keyboards instead. Why? Consistency.

Working from home means that I move around the house and switch between the big iMac and the MBP. The differences between the HHKB and Magic Keyboard layouts aren't trivial, and switching between them requires significant adjustments to my muscle memory. It's too much.

I can't tell you how nice it is to have actual arrow keys.

I expect to buy the new Magic Keyboard for the iPad once it's available, so that's yet another keyboard with "normal" layout and feel. 

I'm going to sacrifice perfection for consistency for a while. Oh, and the 16" MBP keyboard is great. So good that I've nearly forgotten about that butterfly abomination from earlier. Forgotten, but not forgiven :).
