# The MyHeritage Photo Enhancer

I ran one of my favorite [found negatives](https://galleries.baty.net/#15794829842807) through the [MyHeritage Photo Enhancer](https://blog.myheritage.com/2020/06/introducing-the-myheritage-photo-enhancer/) and I have to admit it's pretty impressive.

> The photos are enhanced using this specialized technology and are not manually retouched in any way. The technology infers what the original faces may have looked like by bringing blurry low-resolution or low-quality photos into clear focus.

The process focuses on faces in the photos and leaves the rest alone. It's worked amazingly well on the handful of images I've tested. I want this for all of my very old negative and photo scans. Unfortunately, it requires a subscription to MyHeritage, in which I'm not interested. 

The technology behind all this is licensed, so it must be available elsewhere. If you know where I might find it, drop me a line.
