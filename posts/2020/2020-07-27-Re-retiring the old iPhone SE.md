# Re-retiring the old iPhone SE

I've only had it [out again for a few weeks](https://www.copingmechanism.com/2020/iphone-se-og), but I've already put my beloved iPhone SE back in the drawer. As much as I love its size, shape, and Touch ID, the little SE doesn't fit as well into my life as well as the X. Its battery only gives me about a half-day of use. It doesn't fit in my car holder. It's a lot slower, and the camera is much worse. I could probably take care of most of these if I tried hard enough, but I'd just be swimming upstream. 

Apple isn't going to make another small phone like the SE. I'm better off moving on. It's disappointing, but fine. It's just a phone.
