# I miss Blot

Since archiving my Hugo blog at [baty.net](https://baty.net) and moving my blogging to [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com), I've been feeling nostalgic for a simple, text-based workflow. It started when I "accidentally" opened my Blot folder in VS Code (don't ask). There all my posts were, organized in folders, as plain text. 

Now, blog posts fall squarely at the "Records" end of the [Thoughts vs Records](https://copingmechanism.com/2020/thoughts-vs-records/) spectrum, so posts in plain text are ideal. 

[Blot](https://blot.im) has always struck a good balance between the simplicity of text and ease of use. I like using CMSs like WordPress and Ghost because the words are _right there_: type, save, done. Blot works much the same way.

I wish I could say that I wasn't thinking of reviving this blog for something, but I'd be lying.
