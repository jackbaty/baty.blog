# Arq 6 upgrade issues - Michael Tsai

[Michael Tsai's notes on the Arq 6 update](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/04/13/arq-6/):

> Overall, it just seems like the app was shipped before it was ready

> I still think that Arq, uniquely, gets the overall backup architecture right. Arq 6 makes major progress, but it also has some serious regressions. Most importantly, it needs more testing and refinement. I do not recommend updating right now. Arq 5 still works great. Thereâ€™s no rush.

I've used Arq for years and it's great, so I fully intend to upgrade. Just not right now.
