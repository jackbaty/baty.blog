# Configuration Fatigue

Why am I so tired? I think it's from spending so much time and energy configuring things.

I spent 2 hours yesterday trying some new visual config changes to Emacs for no good reason. Because micro-managing font faces is _important_! I'm not even supposed to be using Emacs, for crying out loud.

Then I farted with my [TiddlyWiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki) for a while because I couldn't decide if I wanted a sidebar visible or not and how should backlinks look, anyway?

After spending a week committing to using Lightroom Classic for _everything_ related to my photography workflow, I ditched it entirely and have been setting up Capture One Pro and Photo Mechanic, which is what I used for a long time and had the whole workflow basically nailed. Now I've gotta start over. Again.

I have external hard drives, a Synology, and Backblaze for storage. You think I can come up with a decent, stable storage and backup setup? I can! But then I decide to configure it differently the next day because what if?

My Hugo-based blog at [baty.net](https://www.baty.net) was breaking during builds for no reason I could find. I thought I'd try updating the theme but I'd forgotten how because I had recently reconfigured things to use Hugo modules instead of Git submodules. I just want to write and post something. Is that too much to ask?

I recently replaced my MacBook Pro and iMac with M1 versions of the MacBook Air and Mac Mini. I started from scratch with both, and it's been _weeks_ of configuration and I'm still not done.

Sometimes I think of all this configuration as just having fun tinkering with computer stuff. I've loved tinkering for as long as I can remember. Lately, though, spending time configuring things feels too much like work; like a crippling distraction rather than a fun diversion. 

You'll note that I'm posting this to my [Blot.im](https://blot.im) blog. Why? Because it's easier and there's really nothing to configure and right now that is a welcome change. And I still haven't fixed Hugo.

Maybe it's actually "Decision Fatigue".
