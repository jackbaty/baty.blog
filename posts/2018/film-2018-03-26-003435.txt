# Mauvais Sang, 1986 - ★★★★

<img class="poster" src="/_img/letterboxd-review-38836872" />

Some things make no sense and it doesn't even matter. "Mauvais Sang" was something I could not look away from, even when I had no idea what was going on. Like Carax's later "Holy Motors," this was a film to just sit back and let happen.
