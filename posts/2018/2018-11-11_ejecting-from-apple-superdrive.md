# Ejecting a CD stuck in an Apple SuperDrive

{>}![](/_img/2018/2018-11-11_slaughter.jpg)

Since setting up my [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) system, I've been re-ripping all my CDs to FLAC format. My Apple SuperDrive stopped reliably ejecting CDs so I ordered another one, which developed the same problem. Every 2nd or 3rd disk would fail to eject and I'd have to retry a few times. 

Finally, Slaughter's "Stick It To Ya" (don't judge me) simply refused to come out. When trying to eject the CD, the drive would click a few times and re-mount as if it was hitting something on the way out. As a last-ditch attempt, I **turned the drive upside down** and asked gravity to help.

The upside down trick has worked every time since.
