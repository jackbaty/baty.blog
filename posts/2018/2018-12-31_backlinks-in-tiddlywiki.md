# Backlinks in TiddlyWiki

A nice feature of wikis is backlinks. A good wiki will keep track of which pages link back to a given page. [TiddlyWiki][1] does this, but does not display them by default. I set out to add them and it was way more difficult than I expected. Iâ€™m new to TiddlyWiki but, after a lot of trial and error, I figured it out.

I took notes on the wiki, naturally. [Adding Backlinks to TiddlyWiki][2]
