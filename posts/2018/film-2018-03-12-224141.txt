# The Death of Stalin, 2017 - ★★★

<img class="poster" src="/_img/letterboxd-review-38113791" />

Armando Iannucci's "In The Loop" is one of my favorite comedies, so I was so looking forward to "The Death of Stalin".

Some day I may watch it again, because I think there is a terrifically funny and very (very) black comedy in there. But, I found it difficult to laugh while watching people being murdered, raped, and tortured nearly the entire time.

"Shoot her before him, but make sure he sees it." hahahaha!

Beria was a serial rapist of young girls, so watching him being played for laughs rubbed me the wrong way, even if they only glanced sideways at that particular bit of history.

I love the funeral scene. And I loved Jason Isaacs as Marshal Zhukov. I loved Stalin's son yelling "You’re not even a person, you’re a testicle," and "You're made mostly of hair!"

Maybe next time I'll suspend my discomfort with rapid-fire execution gags and laugh more. I'd give this 5 stars based on how I _should_ feel about it but 3 stars based on how I _do_ feel.
