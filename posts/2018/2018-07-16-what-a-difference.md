# What a Difference a Generation Makes

My dad told me a story about a broken latch on the tailgate of his pickup.

He took it apart and noticed there was a small green part that had come loose.
He removed the broken pieces and drove to a nearby Chevy dealer.
They weren't sure if such a thing was available as a replacement part. One of
the mechanics then said, "Hold on, someone ordered one of those and never picked
it up. You can have it for $6.00."

Satisfied, my dad went home, reassembled everything, and now has a working
tailgate. It cost him a couple hours and $6.00.

I would have just bought a new truck.
