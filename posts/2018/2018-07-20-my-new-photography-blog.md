# My Photography Website

I've tried a few times to maintain a separate website dedicated to photography. It's never stuck. I don't remember why, exactly, but it's usually been due to either weak display of photos or weak blogging features. I like SmugMug for display but not for blogging. I like some WordPress themes for blogging but not for photos. I could never seem to find both at the same time. I'm sure there's _something_ out there, but it eluded me.

I've been experimenting with Squarespace and finding that it does a good job of combining blogging and photo galleries. I picked a theme, added some photos, imported some old blog posts, and was surprised that I kind of like it.

The new site is at **[photos.baty.net](https://photos.baty.net/)** and it's a work in progress. Maybe this will rekindle my interest in photography or maybe it'll be another dead end. I hope it turns out to be the former.
