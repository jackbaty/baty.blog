# Holding Dear: The Value of the Real by Steve Leveen

{<}![](/_img/2018/2018-11-10_holding-dear.jpg)

"[Holding Dear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17357293-holding-dear)" begins with Steve Leveen telling the story of how he and his wife Lori started [Levenger](https://www.levenger.com) back in 1987. I've been buying stuff from Levenger for many years and Leveen strikes me as sincerely interested in providing "Tools for Serious Readers"

The remainder of the book consists of short pieces by various people writing about "real" objects and what they mean to them.

Examples:

- Kevin Kelly - a digital camera
- David McCullough - his typewriter
- David Allen - whiteboards
- Patty Smith - Levenger's Jefferson Writing Desk

The book was a quick, enjoyable read and made me feel a little better about being attached to some of my things.
