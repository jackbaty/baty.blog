# Annihilation, 2018 - ★★★★

<img class="poster" src="/_img/letterboxd-review-38165370" />

Now this is my kind of science fiction. Filled with interesting themes, striking visuals, big ideas, and a few loose ends. In fact the ending was vague enough that it left me feeling almost-but-not-quite cheated.

And how about that bear monster scene! Thrilling and creepy.
