# I Don’t Believe in Blockchain - Tim Bray

[Tim Bray][1]

> "First off, I should say that I like blockchain, conceptually. Provably-immutable append-only data log with transaction validation based on asymmetric crypto, and (optionally) a Byzantine-generals solution too! What’s not to like? But I still don’t think the world needs it."

I don't know enough about blockchain to have a valid opinion, but I dismissed it outright anyway.
