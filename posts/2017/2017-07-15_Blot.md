# Blot

[Blot][1] has been popping up in my feed at [micro.blog][2].

> Blot turns a Dropbox folder into a blog.
> 
> Use your favourite app to write. Just drag-and-drop files into Blot’s folder to publish them. Images, text files, Markdown and more become blog posts automatically. There’s no interface. Just files and folders.

I've tried a number of these blogging-via-dropbox things and they've all disappeared. Still, I paid the $20/year fee for blot.im (charging for the service is a good sign) and started this blog just to get a feel for it. It feels pretty good. 

Blot.im is clever, simple, good-looking by default, and cheap.
