# Things I want - Jamie Todd Rubin

[Jamie Todd Rubin](https://www.jamierubin.net/2019/01/26/things-i-want/):

> I want a classic barometer that I can refer to for changes in the weather. I have three different weather apps on my phone, none of which agree with one another, nor with what I can see outside my window on a typical day.

> I want an old-fashioned address book. Each year, come the holiday season, it seems that my Contacts are always missing information. I diligently update them each season, and yet, information still goes missing. Perhaps there is a leak somewhere and the information seeps through a crack in the foundation. Good old fashioned address books donâ€™t have this problem.

He lists a few others, but these are the ones I can most easily relate to.

I have an old-fashioned address book and I use it regularly when writing letters. I like seeing addresses edited, crossed out, or otherwise modified over time, showing when people have moved or changed phone numbers, etc.

There was a very old barometer hanging in the basement of my house. I didn't take it with me when I moved and I wish I had. It's something I'd like to replace.
