# Hello (Again) Ello - Om Malik

[Om Malik on Ello](https://om.co/2019/01/24/hello-again-ello/):

> It is the antithesis of the likes-fueled, influencer-juiced world of Instagram and its algorithmic overlordship of creativity. If Instagram is the machine and crowd-powered enemy of creativity for the sake of creativity, Ello is just a place where there are fewer judgments about the art. It is not just about photos. There is art, fashion, music, design, architecture â€” and it feels like the East Village long before the faux-pubs, condos and the Whole Foods turned it into urban-suburbia. 

I had high hopes for [Ello](https://ello.co) but Om is right that it has sort of faded from view. 

My [most recent post](https://ello.co/jackbaty/post/p-nyi98_e2ikm3qz-4zrjg) was from 2 years ago, so I added another one today. I love that Ello _feels_ different. I'm just not sure I have a place for it. Just in case, I'm [@jackbaty](https://ello.co/jackbaty) there.
