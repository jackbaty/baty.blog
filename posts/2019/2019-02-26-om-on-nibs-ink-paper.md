# Nibs, Ink and Paper - Om Malik

Om Malik on [Nibs, Ink and Paper](https://om.co/2019/02/26/nibs-ink-and-paper/):

> It has been said that writing on paper helps us remember better, and at this stage of my life, I can use all the help I can get. It is a real shame more people donâ€™t use fountain pens â€” it can be such an antidote to constantly peering into our screen and thumbing our way to the carpal tunnel syndrome.

Om gets it.
