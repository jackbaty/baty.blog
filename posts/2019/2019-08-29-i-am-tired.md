# I am tired

The last week or so has been exhausting. I haven't been busy or stressed or anything. I'm just tired. Tired of the news. Tired of having to decide things. Tired of changing my mind. Tired of changing my systems/software/processes. 

I'm tired, and yet here I am still doing all the things that got me feeling this way in the first place.
