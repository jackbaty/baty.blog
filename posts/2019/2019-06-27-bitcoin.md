# Bitcoin

I don't even resemble an expert in cryptocurrency, but my gut says the whole thing is some sort of mass delusion. I mean, read Twitter after any price fluctuation (up or down), and it's wall-to-wall rationalization. 

These people are just so deeply enamoured with the _idea_ of crypto that they seem to have lost all sense of reason. I don't want to call them crazy, but I kind of do.

Anyway, I own a little Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin, and one other that I don't remember. I don't spend more on it than I can afford to lose, but I admit to hedging my bets with the upside potential.

It's sort of a Pascal's wager in that if I'm wrong, I still win.

It's just that my timing is, as always, terrible.
