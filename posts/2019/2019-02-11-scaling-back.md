# Scaling back so I can think

There was no internet at my house for two days last week and I don't like the way it made me feel. I felt lost without the constant drip of new _stuff_ to read.

Once the connection was restored, I was reminded that every idle moment brought with it a compulsion to reload the open tabs in my browser. Feed me, internet! That can't be healthy, and it sure as hell isn't productive.

My own thoughts are pushed away by the constant influence of other minds. Blog posts, tweets, news articles, podcasts, audio books fill every gap with the thoughts of others. How am I supposed to think for myself?

I'd like to try scaling back for a while to see if it helps rewire the way I think. To see if it _allows_ me to think.

This means I may not see your post, tweet, or comment right away. I'll still be jotting things down here or on [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org). And of course there's always [email](mailto:jack@baty.net).
