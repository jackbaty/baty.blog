# Bug Fixes (Paul Ford)

[Paul Ford, NYT Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html):

> But in the end, the software works or it doesnâ€™t. Politics, our personal health, our careers or lives in general â€” these do not provide a narrative of unalloyed progress. But software, dammit, can and _does_. Itâ€™s a pleasure to watch the code change and improve, and itâ€™s also fascinating to see big companies, paid programmers and volunteers learning to work together (the Defense Department is way into open source) to make those changes and improvements. I read the change logs, and I think: _Humans can do things_.
