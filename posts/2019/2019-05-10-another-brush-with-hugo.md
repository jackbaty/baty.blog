# Another brush with Hugo and baty.net

I search my old blog ([baty.net](https://www.baty.net)) nearly every day looking for some reference or topic. I stopped posting there earlier this year, and I often feel like I miss it.

I like the [theme](https://github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane) and I like static HTML controlled by version-controlled Markdown files. And I like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so last night I dusted it off and got things configured again. I even published a couple posts.

What I realized immediately is that even though Hugo is great, [Blot](https://blot.im) offers nearly all the benefits in an easier-to-use package.

I ended up moving things around on baty.net so that the home page is now a giant list of every post going back to 2000. I have no intention to post there any time soon. ðŸ˜”

I'm still down to (only!) three blogs.

- [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) - You're soaking in it
- [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com) - It's new and I'm not sure what it's for yet
- [micro.baty.net](https://micro.baty.net) - My [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) blog

That should do it, right?
