# c2md - Output HTML clipboard contents to markdown in the terminal

One benefit of working with so many smart people is sometimes they hear you wondering about things.

I'd been using [Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/) for converting text copied from a browser to Markdown for use in blog posts, etc. It works great, but I thought it would be nice to have something local and executable via a terminal.

[Karl](https://karlswedberg.com/) overheard me talking about it and so he made something for me.

**[c2md](https://github.com/kswedberg/c2md)** is a small utility that does exactly what I needed.

A quick `npm install -g c2md` and boom!

Thanks Karl!
