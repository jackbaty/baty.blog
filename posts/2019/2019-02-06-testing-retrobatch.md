# Testing Retrobatch

[Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) from Flying Meat is "Flexible, super charged, batch image processing for your Mac."

I thought I'd try it and it works great. I created a simple workflow for photos I want to share on my blog.

It does this:

#. Grabs all images in a folder
#. Removes location/GPS data
#. Adds my signature watermark
#. Outputs the modified images to another folder

Neat!

Now, if it could also upload to, say, Flickr, or Instagram or somewhere via SFTP that would be perfect.
