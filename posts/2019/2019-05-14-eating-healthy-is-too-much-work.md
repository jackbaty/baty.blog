# I'm Upset: "Eating Healthy" is too much work (The Outline)

[Casey Johnston, The Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/7429/im-upset-eating-healthy-is-too-much-work):

> Why is the subset of food I should be eating so vanishingly small compared to all the food I can buy? Why is it so hard to make normal, healthyish food, and why is there so much other irresponsible livelihood-endangering food all in the way?

I've been working on some dietary changes and I'm upset too.
