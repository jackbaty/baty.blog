I've [resurrected baty.net](https://www.baty.net/2019/resurrecting-baty.net-for-now/), so what happens to this blog? Nothing. It's not going anywhere, but I'm looking at other was to make use of it. Blot is great at doing stuff with images, html files, etc. Maybe I'll make it a photo blog. Or maybe it'll become about a specific topic.

While I think through this, you'll probably notice more new posts at [baty.net](https://www.baty.net).
