# The Leica M4 is back in action

![](/_img/2019/2019-08-06-leicam4.jpg)

Finally, Iâ€™ve gotten my beloved Leica M4 out of storage. Itâ€™s been in a case in my basement since last yearâ€™s move and thatâ€™s a shame.

The camera was made in 1966 and I bought it in 2009. Itâ€™s seen regular, if sporadic, use since then. I think itâ€™s beautiful, and I especially like that it has the M3-style levers.

I have the tiny and terrific Voightlander 35mm Color Skopar on it. That lens is almostÂ _too_small, but it makes fine images and was inexpensive.

It feels good to be using this setup again. Iâ€™ll run a few rolls through it and see if I still become fatigued shooting with no meter at all.
