# These photos aren't for you - Missy Mwac

[Missy Mwac](https://missymwac.com/these-photos-arent-for-you/)

> Actually, I think more about the photos we DON’T take…all those precious images that are missed because of a whole host of reasons:
> 
> “I want to lose weight first.”  
> “I don’t like the way I look in pictures.”  
> “Oh, just photograph the kids.”  
> “I’ll get around to it later.”  
> 
> And the truth is, none of those excuses matter, because these pictures you are taking, these photographs you are printing, they aren’t for YOU: they are for your kids…and their kids…and their kids…and their kids….

She's right
