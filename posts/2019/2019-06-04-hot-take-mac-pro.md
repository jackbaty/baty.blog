# Finally, I can tweet knowledgeably on a topic, the new Mac Pro & display (Pusateri)

It's amazing to see so many people complaining about the cost of something they have no real use for and could never fully utilize even if they think they could. 

I am idiotic enough to _want_ one at home, but not enough to actually _buy_ one.
