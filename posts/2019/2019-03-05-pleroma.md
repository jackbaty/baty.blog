# I'm running a Pleroma.social instance

Just for fun, I installed [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social) on a little GCP Debian instance. It was easy. Nothing like the mess that is Mastodon. Very few dependencies and low server requirements.

Following Mastodon users works like a charm. It's so compatible with Mastodon that it ships with an optional Mastodon front end.

It's running at [mb.baty.net](https://mb.baty.net) but I don't know what I'll do with it. Gotta find a better domain name, that's for sure.
