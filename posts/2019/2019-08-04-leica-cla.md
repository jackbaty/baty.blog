# Sending the Leica M3 in for repair and CLA

![Leica M3](/_img/2019/leica-m3.jpg)

The rangefinder in my 1960 Leica M3 needs repair. It stops moving when focused closer than about 4 feet. Time for a complete CLA.

I bought this M3 in 2013 and it had apparently been CLAâ€™d by Youxin Ye in 2012. I guess itâ€™s time for another. Iâ€™m sending it to the highly-regardedÂ [DAG Camera Repair](https://www.dagcamera.com/). Iâ€™m including the 50mm Summicron, just in case he determines that could also use a bit of work.

Itâ€™s not inexpensive having these cameras taken care of like this, but a few hundred dollars every five or ten years ends up being a small investment. At this rate I should be able to get another 60 years out of it. Well,Â _someone_Â will.
