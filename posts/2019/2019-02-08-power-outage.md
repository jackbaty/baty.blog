# Power outage as productivity booster

Ice storms took power out for miles around yesterday. We got lucky and
our house was only affected for about 12 hours and temperatures
weren't too far below freezing.

I get so much done when the power is out. Closets get cleaned,
paperwork gets filed, drawers get organized, journals get written,
books get read.

We should ask the power companies to randomly pick a few hours once or
twice a month to just shut it all down.
