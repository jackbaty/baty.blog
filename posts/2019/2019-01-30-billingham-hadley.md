# Billingham Hadley Small Pro Camera Bag

After years of oscillating between _wanting_ and _ridiculing_ Billingham bags, I landed on _want_ and bought a "[Hadley Small Pro Camera Bag](https://billingham.co.uk/collections/camera-bags/products/hadley-small-pro?variant=10677772419115)" in black.

I didn't need it, I wanted it, and I like it.

I already have a small [Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling-5) and it's a nice bag, but it's a tad _too_ small. There's not room for much more than just a camera/lens. The Hadley is not that much bigger in dimensions, but it holds much more. The outside pockets help.

With one small bag and two different "kits", I found myself swapping things around a lot and thinking about new bags. I don't seem to need a reason to think about new bags, I just do it.

[Mike Johnston's post about Billingham bags](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2019/01/billingham-bags.html) pushed me over the edge, and a few minues later I had one on the way.

I haven't used it in anger yet, but first impressions are wonderful. The small Hadley Pro is the perfect size for a mirrorless camera and a few lenses, along with the usual supporting knick knacks. It's built well and looks great. I thought the tan ones were a bit showy so I went with plain black with black leather.

So now I have another new bag. It's a nice one.
