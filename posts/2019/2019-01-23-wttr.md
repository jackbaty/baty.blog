# A new way of including the weather in my Org Journal

I nearly forgot about [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in). Curl wttr.in in a terminal with a few parameters and you get a nice "graphic" weather forecast.

I use it in my [Org-Journal](https://rudimentarylathe.org/#Org-Journal) to show the weather for the day

Here's the bit I insert at the top of new journal org-mode files:

```
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results value verbatim
curl "wttr.in/49301?0pQT"
#+END_SRC
```

Just execute that block (Ctl-c Ctl-c) and it inserts something like this:

```
    _`/"".-.     Light Snow
     ,\_(   ).   21-30 °F
      /(___(__)  ↘ 12 mph
        *  *  *  9 mi
       *  *  *   0.0 in
                            .
```
