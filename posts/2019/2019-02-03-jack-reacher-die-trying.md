# Die Trying (Jack Reacher #2) 

{>} ![](/_img/2019/2019-02-03-die-trying.jpg)

This was my [second Jack Reacher
novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40092133-die-trying). I
enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how many more I'll end up reading.

So many handy coincidences. So many conveniently attractive female
characters, and of course they're unable to resist the accidental
charms of Mr. Reacher.

Much of it was fun and fast-paced, but the Eye Roll Factor was a little too high.
