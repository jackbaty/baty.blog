# Pinning Butterflies

[Eli Mellen](https://eli.li/2019/06/29/link-logging):

> Question: what is to be done with the stuff after it has been cataloged and stored? Are we pinning butterflies for the sake of pinning them, or is there a moment of beholding, and re-use/re-mix down the line?

> Save and make? Transform?

This raises a great question: Which butterflies to pin[^pin]?

I'm not one to think that we need to carefully archive *everything*, but there are many seemingly useless things that *should* be saved but aren't. One never knows what will prove valuable over time. Or what might be re-mixed in the future. I fall into the better-safe-than-sorry camp, but determining what to archive and what to just let go can be a crazy-making problem.

[^pin]: I've never heard it expressed as "pinning butterflies" before. I love that. Thanks Eli!
