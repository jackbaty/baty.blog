# Adding On This Day feature to Blot - Amit Gawande

[Amit](https://blog.amitgawande.com/) strikes again with [Adding On This Day feature to Blog](https://blog.amitgawande.com/add-on-this-day).

> **TL;DR:** Expose a JSON feed on your site. Create two views in Blot using the gist [flashback.js](https://gist.github.com/am1t/5bcbc5366491c2b010adfe1358877899) and [on-this-day.html](https://gist.github.com/am1t/472499285986345f34c61274edd22cdc). You should have two additional pages, you can use the same file names. If you do, you can access your On This Day page at `/on-this-day`.
