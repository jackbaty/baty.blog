# What I'm using Emacs for 

{>} ![](/_img/emacs.png)

My use of Emacs varies with my mood, but this is how I'm using it today.

I'm using Emacs for...
----------------------

*   creating formatted documents (proposals, etc.)
*   daily journaling
*   logging events in my daybook
*   writing blog posts
*   managing my finances with ledger-mode
*   tracking weight
*   recording meals
*   and general text editing.

I'm no longer using Emacs for...
--------------------------

* Task management
* Email

I'm no longer using it for email or task management. This is weird, because managing my TODOs using OrgMode is why I started using Emacs in the first place.

Using Mu4e for email is fun and neat, but it's also quite fussy. It requires syncing with `mbsync` and running `mu` regularly, which means I have to wait 30 seconds before I can see my email. It's also tricky viewing more than one message at a time, which I do frequently. Most emails benefit from seeing the HTML version, so I'm always hitting `a V` to see messages in my browser. I'm not sure this is all worth it.
