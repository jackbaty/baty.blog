My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2705366390">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I like Douglas Rushkoff's ideas around civilization and human-ness. I agree with him in general about the isolating effects of the way we "connect" today. What I didn't love about the book is that so many of his 100 "statements" just say things as if they're obviously true. I wasn't always so sure. I also think I could have gotten as much out of watching a few more of his videos on YouTube. 

I have to admit that I mostly skimmed the last half of the book.
