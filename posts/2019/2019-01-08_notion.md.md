# Said I'd like to know where, you got the Notion

{>} ![](/_img/notion.png)

I keep reading that people love [Notion.so][1], and I don’t mean to rock the boat, but I don’t get it. I tried kicking it around a few times and almost nothing about it clicks for me. Notion strikes me as one of those things that tries to do everything but ends up doing nothing well.

I can’t imagine using it with a team and them being able to keep track of what’s used for what and why. I couldn’t even get a team to manage a few todo lists in Asana.

If enough people keep raving, I’m sure I’ll give Notion another go. But for now, `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
