# Microsoft and Linux and a shift away from Apple

Take a moment to read the [excerpts collected by Michael Tsai](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/05/10/windows-to-include-a-full-linux-kernel/) in his post linking to Microsoft's announcement that they'll be shipping a full Linux kernel with Windows.

Now tell me there's not a shift happening in the Mac/Windows/Linux development ecosystem. From where I'm sitting, it's not looking like a shift _toward_ Apple.
