# Coping with the mechanism

I am fully aware that putting together the [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com) blog is probably a mistake. I couldn't help myself.

But what is it? I feel like it has to be more than just another tool I use to post the usual stuff. That's what baty.blog and micro.blog are for. I've got that covered, so no.

It could be about photography, or poetry, or "morning pages" or whatever. Maybe it could be nothing but "meta" posts about what I'm trying this week. Doesn't matter, but it has to be _something_. I'll have to think about it and if I come up empty I'll pull the plug.
