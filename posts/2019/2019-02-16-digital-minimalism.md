My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2712165131">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I enjoyed it. Cal has never had a social media account. Counter-intuitively, this gives him a clear perspective of the cost/benefit balance offered by social networks. He offers a number of actionable ways to reduce and clarify how we interact with devices and other people.
