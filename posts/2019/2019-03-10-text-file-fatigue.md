# Text File Fatigue

I originaly wrote the following in 2015 (on a blog I seem to have misplaced).

I start wishing things could be a little more fancy. Nicer. First thing I usually do is try a different theme in my editor. That helps for a little while, yet I still long for _pretty_, not just "not ugly".

I've gone round and round about this over the years, but for the most part I seem to always end up in plain text. But, I also understand that not everything needs the plain-text-future-proof treatment. So, I sometimes use Tinderbox or TiddlyWiki or Curio or TheBrain or whatever makes the most sense for the _purpose_ of the text. Context matters more than a blanket "everything must be plain text!" rule.

I'm typing this in Emacs.
