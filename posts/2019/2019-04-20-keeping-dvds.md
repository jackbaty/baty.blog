> There are advantages to DVDs and Blu-Rays we give up when we rely on streaming services

He lists a dozen or so very good reasons one would prefer DVDs to streaming services. He didn't mention a personal favorite of mine, and that is...

When looking for something to watch, I much prefer running my hands along shelves lined with DVDs to scrolling around the chaos of Netflix or iTunes or Amazon or whatever[^also]. Related: I've had about enough of unhelpful "You might also like!..." suggestions everywhere.
