# Possible revival for the failing TETENAL company

[Emulsive](https://emulsive.org/articles/news/new-tetenal-taking-over-operations-and-production-from-insolvent-parent-company):

> An employee initiative in the form of a management buy out has offered to purchase all photochemical formulas, the Tetenal brand and the production facilities of its former employer starting April 1st 2019.
> 
> It was reported today by German-based publication, PhotoKlassik International that NEW TETENAL will take over operations and production from the insolvent Tetenal Europe GmbH and expects to take orders and engage with industry partners as early as the beginning of March 2019.

This is a good sign for those of us who use Tetenal products for color film processing.
