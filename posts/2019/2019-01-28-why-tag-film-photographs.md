# Why tag film photographs? - Bijan Sabet

[Bijan Sabet](https://bijansabet.com/2019/01/28/whytagfilmphotos/):

> Photographs made with film aren't necessarily better but they can be beautiful and meaningful. I think tagging exposes the merits of film and encourages people to try it. And the more we shoot with film, the longer it will be around.


This is exactly how I feel. I hear things like "It doesn't matter what was used. The only thing that matters is the photograph". Yeah yeah, whatever you say, Mr. Serious Artist. I *like* knowing what film/camera/lens combination was used to create a photo. It's inspirational and encouraging. I tag mine because I like it when others tag theirs.
