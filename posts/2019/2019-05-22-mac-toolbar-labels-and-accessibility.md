#  Mac Toolbar Labels and Accessibility (Michael Tsai)

[Michael Tsai](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/05/22/mac-toolbar-labels-and-accessibility/):

> At first, I thought this title-free design was intended for single-window apps, but Apple also uses it Safari and Xcode. And itâ€™s been appearing in third-party apps like MarsEdit, OmniFocus, and ReadKitâ€”a shame

I wish that most, maybe all, apps still had title bars. Title bars a great at things like, oh, showing a title and giving me a consistent drag target. I move windows all the time, and it's gotten too hard to drag windows, since the only place you can use to drag is covered with buttons.
