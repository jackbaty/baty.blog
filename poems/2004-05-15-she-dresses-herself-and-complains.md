# She dresses herself and complains

She dresses herself and complains  
Her socks don't match  
the ones She wants are in the wash  
but these will do today  
  
She kisses me goodbye at school  
briefer every day  
i tell Her i'm late and  
wave absentmindedly  
  
She tells me when i pick Her up  
"look what I made today"  
i tell Her that it's beautiful  
but later throw it away  
  
She wants to play when we get home  
i'm pretty busy though  
i have a lot of work to do and still  
haven't washed those socks  
  
She wants to read a book with me  
before going to bed  
i read too fast and think of something  
i forgot today  
  
She sleeps and i remember what it was  
that slipped my busy mind  
i forgot to be the father  
that i had expected to be  
  
She wakes me in the morning  
wanting breakfast  
something She can put sugar on  
if you don't mind  
  
i don't mind
