# the dress reveals nothing really

the dress reveals nothing really  
(cotton, isn't it?)  
but quietly suggests the subtle  
and delicate promise of all that  
Spring has told me  
yet never gets quite right.  
  
clarified now by soft color  
against the perfect whiteness of skin  
clever Spring! never spoke of you  
  
one hand touches both flower and flesh  
as Spring sits silently&#8230;waiting.
