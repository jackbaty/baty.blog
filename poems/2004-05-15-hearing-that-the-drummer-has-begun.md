# hearing that the drummer has begun

hearing that the drummer has begun  
She &#8211; being the dancer &#8211; moves,  
smiling slightly behind closed eyes  
knowing this particular rhythm  
  
ignoring the confused stares  
i &#8211; watching the dancer &#8211; sit very still,  
nodding slowly as if in agreement  
knowing that particular smile&#8230;  
&#8230;and begin to sing.
