# I met a man who had traveled far.

I met a man who had traveled far.  
"Show me a place where I'll find love.", I said  
It was a long journey  
We walked for many days  
We came to a beautiful white place.  
He said, "This is where you wished to go."  
I asked if he was coming too  
He answered, "No, I've been here before."  
And sadly walked on.
