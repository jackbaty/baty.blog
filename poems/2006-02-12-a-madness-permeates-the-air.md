# A Madness Permeates the Air

Years ago, and sometimes still, I recorded my dreams in a little spiral notebook kept near the bed. The first page of the book contains, written badly using a calligraphy pen (of course), the first part of \_Row, Row, Row, your boat\_, which I must've thought quite clever. Most of the entries are the usual dream stuff &#8211; monsters, sex, flying, falling, biting &#8211; you know. One entry however takes the form of a poem. I don't remember writing it, but I do remember reading it the following morning and thinking I was somehow not entirely sound. It goes like this&#8230; 

> It never had occured to me  
> The way it has to be  
> is never never only what it should be  
>  
> Some this some that some other  
> kid forgets his mother  
> then take the wasted lives of one another  
>  
> It never seemed I never saw  
> true light shine out and on and all  
> the things that come up/down before the fall  
>  
> The growth the life before the rise  
> But once I looked into those eyes  
> Not knowing what could crawl out of the skies  
>  
> Peaks first then ebbs it shrinks and grows  
> Aroma smelled not with the nose  
> A thorn has fallen from life's withered rose  
>  
> Once dust once ash a Phoenix came  
> from out of pointed angry blame  
> And nothing else has ever done the same  
>  
> Over up and once thought dead  
> A voice that rang in angels' heads  
> Now sings a song of loneliness instead  
>  
> Not gone not here not anywhere  
> A madnes permeates the air  
> Strips all and one and thing completely bare  
>  
> And spoken with a raspy breath  
> While looking down upon the earth  
> "All the meek inherit now is death."  

Whatever _that_ means.
