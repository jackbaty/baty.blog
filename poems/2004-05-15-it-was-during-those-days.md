# It was during those days

It was during those days  
strange and wonderful, when  
timid turned to tumultous  
mystery gave way to mastery  
each moment hiding its own fear  
(the possibility of it being the last)  
the early, furtive attempts  
revealed suprising results  
of unbridled motion and sound.  
when we rode that graceful white horse  
of newly discovered combinations of  
movement and placement,  
positional pliability explored  
in a densely passionate fog of  
sweat and breath and smoke.
