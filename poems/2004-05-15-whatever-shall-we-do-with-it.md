# whatever shall we do with it

whatever shall we do with it  
that which has made lovely again  
those things once turned so awful  
the thought of (well, you know)  
and the other things unspoken  
until now  
  
Iâ€™ll tell you  
  
we breath it in and savor justly  
owed not and paid none  
but in time becomes equal  
and fear lives on one side  
balanced as if by the weight  
of so many ghosts  
waiting to be put to rest  
  
this takes it elsewhere and here  
moves it to nothing and all  
circles and centers  
and wraps and unwinds  
frees and ensnares  
it ends and  
  
begins
