# and then of course there are the moments

and then of course there are the moments    
not quite in focus    
yet intensely bright and wishful.    
a strange mixture of fact, emotion and dream.    
projecting themselves into the    
uneven crevices    
formed between past and now    
shielded by those weathered things    
overgrown and protective    
and confused    
i often (seldom) consider that these   
 
moments    

might neither become more focused nor clear    

forever
