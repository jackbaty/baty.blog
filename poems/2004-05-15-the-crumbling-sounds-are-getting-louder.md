# the crumbling sounds are getting louder

the crumbling sounds are getting louder  
once distant hints of nothing  
now cast shadows on my path  
as i walk amongst these narrow things  
  
i gaze not left or right  
but i sense the coming of what  
has always been long away  
and seeing does no good  
  
and as i laugh the echo coming back  
as if reflected from some  
ill-constructed mirror these things  
not nearly quite so funny
