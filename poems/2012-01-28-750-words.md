# A 750 word poem written in one breath

I have been diligently writing my 750words every day for 34 days. Tonight, I had nothing to say, so I thought I'd blurt out a 750 word poem in one breath, without stopping. Technically it's 761 words, but who's counting? I am subjecting you to this not because it's a good poem, but because it's a fast poem. And it was fun to write.

Let's be honest, I must lie  
do or make or cause to cry  
and take your hand from far away  
it's used to only slap and pray  
and see if I just watch and wait  
while all the others give and take  
this may be nothing, all a joke  
but you'll forgive me what I wrote  
and if we fall into a hole  
once and for all we'll know our role  
in which the play plays out its play  
while you've forgotten yesterday  
it is too late to wonder why  
each day and night I pass you by  
to see if you will notice me  
or if you've seen my fleeting glee  
to take us to that very place  
where none are caught despite the chase  
investigate the mother's yarn  
into the other's loving arm  
you've never seen me take a thing  
while dancing into brilliant spring  
each fuck and fancy builds to this  
yet started with an empty kiss  
beware the rending of a heart  
it finishes without a start  
but never knows a single dance  
or makes a thing bereft of chance  
and never runs into the wall  
or curls itself into a ball  
of fate will not allow portents  
or random silly accidents  
not walk not run not move a bit  
for fear of losing all of it  
to theft of joy or bully thus  
then takes so much from each of us  
that such is known but much is lost  
into a fading muddy past  
when each and only runs aground  
we only ever hear the sound  
of fools and creatures lost in time  
who take and get and say "that's mine!"  
should never live to see the day  
in june or august, march or may  
into the darkness shining dim  
and gasp at every thought of him  
who makes the sunlight take its leave  
and all the happy ones bereave  
to wander into lonely rooms  
beneath a single sad mushroom  
that sprang from filth left far behind  
and into crust of earth and rind  
go further onward within reach  
until the darkness has been breached  
it screams a mighty fearful scream  
and tells each of us what to dream  
for fear of wondering aloud  
those things we know are not allowed  
it cannot be it only seems  
that singing is the sound of dreams  
all wrapped in bows of false and fake  
another empty dawn will break  
we see yet we cannot defend  
our actions or our riches lend  
a hand or other limb to those  
who've sliced the thorn off from the rose  
and petals drift among the clouds  
to silence agonizing crowds  
of those without and those within  
who speak of solitude and sin  
and sex and will we ever come  
and when and if we might have some  
in time it shows a perfect time  
a way in which those things sublime  
writhe into out of up and down  
pushing deeper under ground  
we mold our habits foolishly  
while others trip and fall and flee  
but all is wonderful and rich  
and sounds deliver perfect pitch  
with ear to door and wall and earth  
we hear the glowing after birth  
but fail to know what is to come  
our ending is beginnings womb  
for someone elsewhere out to play  
another sense of feigned dismay  
so that we feel each other's pain  
cannot be washed away by rain  
or weather not meant to be known  
a blinding light is never shown  
until the bottom rung we grasp  
unfastening the final clasp  
it falls way under the bed  
never too be seen or said  
that if we cannot hide our need  
and wear it all out on our sleeve  
then take and take and give and get  
but lose that goddamn safety net  
for fear of falling keeps us down  
as if we've never left the ground  
so rise and touch and tamper with  
that softer smaller one who is  
beneath you when you feel as low  
when nothing is allowed to grow  
and reach and pull and grunt and tug  
into the whole that you have dug  
around and in and up and down  
there is no scream when losing ground  
it takes away the final groan  
and sends the other far from home  
we've never looked into this breach  
and now we fear it's out of reach  
but once we twisted wrapped and warm  
with pleasure covering the harm  
and you and I and nearby sleep  
(I pray there is a soul to keep)  
we barely notice when the quiver  
changes to a shameful shiver
