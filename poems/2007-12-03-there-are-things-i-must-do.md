# There are things I must do

There are things I must do  
all of them terribly important  
today they are terribly important  
Certainly there's a mown lawn  
a clean car, a balanced checkbook  
a collection of tasks  
gleefully crossed off  
one list or another  
all leading to a future safely  
lined with the comfort of having finished  
so many very important things  
  
But in the meantime  
Where is the art?  
When will the poems be written?  
Where is the love?  
Who will teach me to play music &#8211; and when?  
And what will the children remember?
