# That's my boyfriend! she tells us

"That's my boyfriend!" she tells us  
as the grey-haired man pushes himself  
slowly backward. Using his feet.  
The wheelchair moved more easily that way.  
  
"I think the world of her," he says  
being careful not to move too quickly  
lest he jar his neck brace. (She calls it a "halo.")  
His age amplifying his injuries  
  
Her face, at age 91, beams as he says this.  
And she suddenly looks exactly  
as I imagine she did at age 18  
Kind words will do that  
Those kind in particular  
Especially in this place
