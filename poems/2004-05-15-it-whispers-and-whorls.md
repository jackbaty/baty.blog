# it whispers and whorls

it whispers and whorls  
beneath the senseless grinning.  
the little unseen urging  
and never spoken thing.  
it hints of things of wonder  
and wishing oft and quietly.  
but the tongue that could speak  
and make real these things  
becomes tangled by the  
pervasive fear of you.  
and all that is wondered  
and wished for remains  
a deeply vicious longing.  
and becomes and is  
nothing.
